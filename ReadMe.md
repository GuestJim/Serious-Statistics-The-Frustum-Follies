# Serious-Statistics-The-Frustum-Follies

The source files for the Serious Statistics: The Frustum Follies article. This includes the R and Python scripts, data, screenshots and graphics, and LaTeX files for building the article.

The scripts for generating, collecting, and processing the 3DMark data are in 3DMark/@Scripts with an Instructions.txt file to explain how to use them. 3DMark Professional Edition is required to use them though as only it supports the custom benchmark configuration files and command line interface.
